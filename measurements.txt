jib sail area   :   1200 cm2
main sail area  :   2800 cm2
sail ratio      :   1 / 2.333
deck area       :   1931 cm2
hull skirt      :   3209 cm2
sail mast       :   1.5 m
sail boom       :   min 40 cm
jib club        :   min 30 cm (preferably thin bamboo insert)
total pull dist (full boom + club) :   ~ 100 cm @ 70 cm, decidedly 80 cm @ L attachment 40 + 15

not yet designed:
- boom vang (a simple knot should suffice I think, tied on the mast so it pivots along with it)
- gooseneck
- battens for main sail (thinned bamboo stripes, on on each side, glued on both ends so it retains its shape but while still being flexible)
- batten pockets (simply plastic strip glued to the main sail)

#Problems and Solutions
Problem 1: need equal pull for different sized sails, hopefully adjustable
Potential Solutions:
- combine attachments point offsets with block and tackle system (so the jib pulls more to counteract main sail's pull)

Problem 2:
- using tackle reduces flexibility, since block and tackle only works straight
Solutions:
- spare the longest area for this to work, make sure it's smooth

Problem 3: how long of a pull for the main rig. it depends on the sail ratio + attachment points of both sails
Solutions:
- since the sail ratio is 1 : 2.33 it seems that the jib will be attached at 15 cm from its pivot point, while the main sail will be attached at the end of its boom (approx. 40 cm)
- now the pull distance becomes ~78 cm. round it up to 80 cm.
therefore, the tackle is only needed under the deck for the winch

- Alternatively, perhaps if I try to use multiple pulley along the boom
